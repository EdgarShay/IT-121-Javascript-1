<p>Creating two car objects from a car class:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
//The code defines a class named "Car" with a constructor method that takes in 
//two parameters: "name" and "year". 
//The constructor method initializes 
//properties of the object using the "this" keyword.
class Car { 
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}
//Then, the code creates two instances of the "Car" class
//named "myCar1" and "myCar2" using the "new" keyword 
//and passing in arguments for the constructor.

const myCar1 = new Car("Ford", 2014);
const myCar2 = new Car("Audi", 2019);
//Finally, the code sets the innerHTML of the element 
//with the ID "demo" to a string that concatenates 
//the names of both cars separated by a space.
// This string is then displayed on the web page.

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
myCar1.name + " " + myCar2.name;
